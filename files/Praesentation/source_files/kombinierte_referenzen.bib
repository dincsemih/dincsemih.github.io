isbn = {0125852630},
publisher = {Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc.},
address = {San Francisco, CA, USA},
abstract = {This landmark book is the first to describe HDRI technology in its entirety and covers a wide-range of topics, from capture devices to tone reproduction and image-based lighting. The techniques described enable you to produce images that have a dynamic range much closer to that found in the real world, leading to an unparalleled visual experience. As both an introduction to the field and an authoritative technical reference, it is essential to anyone working with images, whether in computer graphics, film, video, photography, or lighting design. New material includes chapters on High Dynamic Range Video Encoding, High Dynamic Range Image Encoding, and High Dynammic Range Display Devices Written by the inventors and initial implementors of High Dynamic Range Imaging Covers the basic concepts (including just enough about human vision to explain why HDR images are necessary), image capture, image encoding, file formats, display techniques, tone mapping for lower dynamic range display, and the use of HDR images and calculations in 3D rendering Range and depth of coverage is good for the knowledgeable researcher as well as those who are just starting to learn about High Dynamic Range imaging Table of Contents Introduction; Light and Color; HDR Image Encodings; HDR Video Encodings; HDR Image and Video Capture; Display Devices; The Human Visual System and HDR Tone Mapping; Spatial Tone Reproduction; Frequency Domain and Gradient Domain Tone Reproduction; Inverse Tone Reproduction; Visible Difference Predictors; Image-Based Lighting.}

title = {Creating HDR Photos: The Complete Guide to High Dynamic Range Photography},
year = {2012},
isbn = {0823085864},
publisher = {Amphoto Books},
address = {Danvers, MA, USA},
abstract = {Since the days of the first photographs, artists have used various techniques to extend the range of lights and darks in their photos. Photographic masters such as Ansel Adams and Edward Weston spent countless hours burning and dodging their prints to create images with extended dynamic range. With the advent of digital photography, new horizons in extending dynamic range are possible. HDR techniques now make it easy to extend the dynamic range of an image well beyond the capability of the human eye. In Creating HDR Photos, bestselling author Harold Davis covers the complete HDR workflow, from choosing the subjects that work best for HDR through processing RAW files to unlock the dynamic power of HDR. You’ll learn how to photograph multiple exposures and blend them into a single HDR image using various software programs. Best of all, you will find out how to control the style of your HDR images, from subtle to hyper-real, using a range of photographic and post-processing techniques. Packed with stunning image examples, Creating HDR Photos brings this essential digital technique within every photographer’s grasp.}

year = {1995},
journal = {Geothermics},
volume = {24},
number = {3},
pages = {307-332},
abstract = {A classification of HDR models by their representation of the reservoir geometry is presented together with the ‘building-block’ sub-processes which embody much of the coupled physics necessary for HDR modelling. A number of current modelling approaches are reviewed. The need for integrating stimulation and circulation models is identified. The need for a good, though not necessarily fully explicit, representation of the reservoir fracture geometry is necessary as a vehicle to express the coupled physics. Limitations on the computational tractability of explicit network models, when strongly coupled physics are added, suggests the types of model that may hold the most promise for future work.}
