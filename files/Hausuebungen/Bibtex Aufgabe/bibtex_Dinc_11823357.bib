abstract = {Since the days of the first photographs, artists have used various techniques to extend the range of lights and darks in their photos. Photographic masters such as Ansel Adams and Edward Weston spent countless hours burning and dodging their prints to create images with extended dynamic range. With the advent of digital photography, new horizons in extending dynamic range are possible. HDR techniques now make it easy to extend the dynamic range of an image well beyond the capability of the human eye. In Creating HDR Photos, bestselling author Harold Davis covers the complete HDR workflow, from choosing the subjects that work best for HDR through processing RAW files to unlock the dynamic power of HDR. You’ll learn how to photograph multiple exposures and blend them into a single HDR image using various software programs. Best of all, you will find out how to control the style of your HDR images, from subtle to hyper-real, using a range of photographic and post-processing techniques. Packed with stunning image examples, Creating HDR Photos brings this essential digital technique within every photographer’s grasp.}

abstract = {A classification of HDR models by their representation of the reservoir geometry is presented together with the ‘building-block’ sub-processes which embody much of the coupled physics necessary for HDR modelling. A number of current modelling approaches are reviewed. The need for integrating stimulation and circulation models is identified. The need for a good, though not necessarily fully explicit, representation of the reservoir fracture geometry is necessary as a vehicle to express the coupled physics. Limitations on the computational tractability of explicit network models, when strongly coupled physics are added, suggests the types of model that may hold the most promise for future work.}
